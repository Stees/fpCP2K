#to create a proper xyz file, the total number of lines we need is the number of atoms plus two additional lines, one containing the number of atoms, and the other being the comment line. We already have the number of atoms from above. Therefore, we need to get the comment line and the atom positions from the final iteration, which are the last 1 + atomsNumber lines of the file.

#One way to accomplish this is to read in all of the lines, determine the total number of lines, and then discard all of them until line # = total number of lines - atomsNumber - 1

#read in all lines
positionFile2 = open(fileName,"r")
lines = positionFile2.readlines()
positionFile2.close()

#determine total number of lines
numOfLines = len(lines)

#what line is the first one that we actually want? Python indexes from 0, so we need:
firstLine = numOfLines - atomsNumber - 2
#because numOfLines will have the integer number of lines.

#open the file for the final positions:
finalPositions = open(outputName,'a')

#now the loop
for j, line in enumerate(lines):
    if j >= firstLine:
        finalPositions.write(line)
